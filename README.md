# curriculum_design
There are 52 cards and we should stimulate getting 4 cards with different colors and draw them using turtle
This is my curriculum design of Python course when I was a freshman in Southwest uni.
I think that there're some points to optimize the code probably because the code is so long, 700+ with the comments.
I'm new to programming and computer science so please give me some advice if you can!
Thanks!
